        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Lumen</span> is a world below the sea filled with many "sea" creatures. You
            are a little spirit who has come to explore this world with your trusty light ball. The creatures are
            curious about this ball of light that you have and approach this ball of light to investigate it, sometimes
            even fighting over it.
            
            <br><br>
            Lumen can be experienced by multiple users across different platforms at the same time.
            Users can explore this world through a VR head-mounted headset, desktop, or mobile device.
            Users can interact with the world by throwing balls of light using their controller or pointer.
            In VR, users can walk, crouch, jump, and look around.
            On mobile, the user can use joysticks to walk around and control the direction of the camera, and flick to
            throw the light.
            On desktop, the user can use WASD to move and their cursor to pan the camera.

            <!-- The creatures are constantly seeking out light sources.
            Agents closer to the user will curiously flock around the user as a light source.
            When the glowing balls are launched into the space, the agents closest to the ball actively seek out the
            light source.
            the agents reproduce and grow in number until a certain maximum.
            All interactions and reactions in this world will produce different feedback from vibrations to sound.
            (reproduction, death, wave, shock, launching and retracting of light balls, ambiance, navigation, etc) -->
        </p>

        <h2>Avatars</h2>
        <p>The user takes on the form of a small "spirit" with a reflective, semi-transparent body, holding a magic
            light ball that attracts creatures. The avatar's primary function is to control the light ball to interact
            with creatures. You can set the colour and head shape of your spirit. Its default head shape is a slightly
            luminous sphere with two black eyes. The hands are also spherical, matching the head's material and
            transparency, creating a cohesive spirit appearance. The semi-transparent spirit appearance
            enhances the game's atmosphere, giving players a unique and engaging character to control.</p>
        
        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <h4>Desktop</h4>
        <p>To start controlling the avatar, the user will need to click on the canvas. You can then use the mouse to
            look around or click to throw the light. Note that this will lock the pointer. To unlock yourself from the
            canvas, press the Escape key ('esc').</p>
        <ul>
            <li>W: Move forward</li>
            <li>A: Move left</li>
            <li>S: Move backward</li>
            <li>D: Move right</li>
            <li>Shift: Run</li>
            <li>Control + Alt: Crouch</li> <!-- What is this on mac? cmd + option? -->
        </ul>
        <h4>Mobile</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Left joystick (red): Move the avatar</li>
            <li>Right joystick (blue): Pan camera</li>
            <li>Tap on the screen to throw the ball of light.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>VR Headset</h4>
        <!-- Broken right now -->
        <ul>
            <li>Use the VR controllers to interact with objects and navigate the environment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Creatures</h2>
        <p>The creatures in Lumen vary in size and shape, creating a diverse ecosystem. These creatures are attracted
            to light sources. They will approach the user, curious about the light that's being held. When the light is
            thrown into the space, those close to it will seek out the light, becoming more erratic and engaging in
            predatory behavior. In the absence of light, the creatures will reproduce and grow in population.</p>
        <p>The aesthetic appeal of this visual effect comes from its vibrant colors and contrast, creating
            depth and dynamic visual interest. The 3D perspective and symmetrical arrangement add spatial depth and
            balance. The overall composition is harmonious and eye-catching.</p>

        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>Lumen immerses users in an underwater environment, evoking the mysterious depths of the ocean. Users will
            find themselves above the seabed, surrounded by swaying seaweed, curious sea creatures, and bubbles floating
            upwards, adding to the sense of being deep below the surface.</p>

        <h2>Sound</h2>
        <p>Sound also plays a role in the immersive experience of Lumen. The ambient soundscape resembles meditation
            music, characterized by soothing, rhythmic tones that create a serene and calming atmosphere. Its muffled
            quality helps users feel as though they are truly underwater, evoking the sensation of being deep beneath
            the surface.</p>
        <p>Various interactions and reactions in the world produce different auditory feedback. These include vibrations
            and sounds associated with reproduction, death, wave emissions, shocks, and launching and retracting light
            balls. The sound design enhances the sense of presence and interaction, making the
            virtual world of Lumen more engaging and lifelike.</p>
